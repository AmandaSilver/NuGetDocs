# Supported extensibility APIs

This page contains the comprehensive list of the supported extensibility API that are exported via MEF by the NuGet Visual Studio extension. Refer to [this tutorial](Invoking-NuGet-Services-from-inside-Visual-Studio "Invoke NuGet Services from inside Visual Studio") to learn how to invoke them.
