## Visual Studio
To check if your copy of Visual Studio already has the NuGet extension, look for *Library Package Manager* in the Tools menu of Visual Studio.  If your copy of Visual Studio does not already have the Library Package Manager (NuGet) extension, you can install it using the Extension Manager.

For Visual Studio 2010, NuGet is available through the Visual Studio Extension Manager.  The extension can be installed into the Professional, Premium, and Ultimate editions.  Additionally, the extension can be installed into Visual Web Developer 2010 Express

Starting with Visual Studio 2012, NuGet is included in every edition (except Team Foundation Server) by default.  Updates to NuGet can be found through the Extension Manager.

To download the extension for Visual Studio 2010 and 2012 directly, it can be found on the [Visual Studio Extension Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c).

For newer versions of Visual Studio, check the general download page [here](https://dist.nuget.org/index.html)


## Command-Line Utility
A command-line NuGet utility is also available.  This utility can be used to create, publish, and download packages.  This utility is also used for NuGet Package Restore which allows packages to be omitted from source control but downloaded as part of your build.

The latest version of the nuget.exe command-line tool is always available from our dist [share](http://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe). Note that this link might introduce breaking changes as it points to the absolute latest RTM build of NuGet.

Because there are a few breaking changes introduced in NuGet 3.2 [https://nuget.org/nuget.exe](https://nuget.org/nuget.exe)  is pointing to the NuGet 2.X latest release, to prevent CI systems from auto upgrading and potentially breaking.
